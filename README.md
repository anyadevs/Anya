# Anya
Anya AI Agent, Gaming, Trading and general purpose intelligence 

Anya is a modular and extensible framework for building advanced AI-powered trading systems. This system is designed to load, clean, and analyze market data, apply machine learning models, and execute trading strategies based on predictions. The project architecture is cleanly organized into configuration, data processing, modeling, and strategy layers for maximum scalability and maintainability.




#DISCLAIMER

This code is a structure/framework so the original Anya cannot be replicated to achive this we have:

1. Added Dummy Implemtation
    - The TradingModel class is implemented with placeholder logic. Its training and prediction methods (train and predict) are simplistic and not based on any actual data analysis or 
       machine learning.
3. Made sure no real data is included.
   - No actual datasets are included in the repository

 4. A Reinforcement Learning Placeholder


Although if you would like to download our framework and create agents similar to Anya:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-agent.git
cd ai-agent
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up environment variables (optional): Create a .env file in the project root and add:

env
Copy code
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///data/agent.db
LOG_LEVEL=INFO


(API SOON)
