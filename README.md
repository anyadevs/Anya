# Anya
Anya AI Agent, Gaming, Trading and general purpose intelligence 

Anya is a modular and extensible framework for building advanced AI-powered trading systems. This system is designed to load, clean, and analyze market data, apply machine learning models, and execute trading strategies based on predictions. The project architecture is cleanly organized into configuration, data processing, modeling, and strategy layers for maximum scalability and maintainability.




## Disclaimer

This code is a structure/framework so the original Anya cannot be replicated to achive this we have:

1. Added Dummy Implemtation
    - The TradingModel class is implemented with placeholder logic. Its training and prediction methods (train and predict) are simplistic and not based on any actual data analysis or machine learning.

3. Made sure no real data is included.
   - No actual datasets are included in the repository

 4. A Reinforcement Learning Placeholder


------
Although if you would like to download our framework and create agents similar to Anya:

##  Installation

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-agent.git
cd ai-agent 
```

### Step 2: Create a virtual environment

```bash 
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
### Step 3: Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Set up environment variables (API SOON)
```bash
Create a .env file in the project root:

API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///data/agent.db
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

## Developers Notes
This project was created by 3 university students who are currently studying data science and machine learning, we were intrigued with the creation of the truth terminal and its involvement with crypto, our main goal is to create an agent that helps with trading and gaming as these are things we enjoy.

After finalization we will create a solana token for anya.
